## Features
- **Async Streaming**: Real-time interactions with seamless data flow
- **Configurable Temperature**: Adjust reasoning depth and response creativity
- **Automatic CoT Injection**: Context-aware logical reasoning integration
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new reasoning/response modules


## How It Works
1. **R1 Reasoning Layer**  
   `deepseek-reasoner` generates structured logical thoughts using:
   - Context analysis
   - Knowledge graph integration
   - Logical deduction algorithms

2. **V3 Response Layer**  
   `deepseek-chat` produces natural language responses by:
   - Incorporating CoT results
   - Maintaining conversational continuity
   - Adapting tone and style dynamically
